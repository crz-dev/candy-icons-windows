## What’s New Here

I’ve converted the original SVG icons (with their symlinks) into PNGs, and then packaged them as `.ico` files ready for Windows. This was done in bulk to make them easy to use, while keeping the structure and naming intact.

## How to Use in Windows
  
1. Right-click on a file, select **Properties** → **Shortcut** → **Change Icon…**  
2. Click **Browse**, then select the desired `.ico` from this collection.  
3. Apply and enjoy your custom icons! On windows!  

> I organized the icons into apps/folders/system to make them easier to find based on the desired icon.
