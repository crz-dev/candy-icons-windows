# Windows Icons Collection

A curated collection of Windows icons converted from the original candy icons by **Eliver Lara**.

## What’s New Here

I’ve converted the original linux SVGs (with their symlinks) into PNGs, and then packaged them as `.ico` files ready for Windows. This was done in bulk to make them easy to use, while keeping the structure and naming intact.  

I organized the output icons into separate folders (apps/folders/system) for easier search of the desired icon.

## Download

You can download **ALL** versions as a zip file from here:
[Download ZIP](https://github.com/crz-dev/candy-icons-windows/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

Otherwise go into `"releases"` in the right part of this page and download a specific one.

**I recommend only downloading and using the "multisized" icons from release v1.2 for consistency accross the system. (They also look better res/cropped)**

## How to Use in Windows
  
1. Right-click on a file, select **Properties** → **Shortcut** → **Change Icon…**  
2. Click **Browse**, then select the desired `.ico` from this collection.  
3. Apply and enjoy your custom icons! On windows!  

> I will update this depending on the amount of new SVGs added to the master branch.
