## What’s New Here

I’ve converted the original linux SVGs (with their symlinks) into PNGs, and then packaged them as `.ico` files ready for Windows. This was done in bulk to make them easy to use, while keeping the structure and naming intact.  

I organized the output icons into separate folders (apps/folders/system) for easier search of the desired icon.

## Download

You can download all icons as a ZIP file from the releases section or from here:  
[Download ZIP](https://github.com/crz-dev/candy-icons-windows/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

**I recommend using the multisized icons for consistency accross the system. (They also look better res/cropped)**
> There is also some slightly modified icons like a blue steam or classic proton in it.

## How to Use in Windows

2. Click **Browse**, then select the desired `.ico` from this collection.  
3. Apply and enjoy your custom icons! On windows!  

> I will update this depending on the amount of new SVGs added to the master branch.
